# 02-512-final-project
## Nov. 30 Meeting Update:
### Three phase plan:
1. Hi-C data synthesis: simulate according to the two segmentation statistic model, link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4147896/
2. TAD boundary finding algorithms: Armatus, HiCSeg(if time allows)
3. Testing accuracy: two measuring indices:
    1. Variation of information: link: https://almob.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-7188-9-14
    2. Jaccard Index: link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index 
4. (Optional) Investigate how to run SpectralTAD: both directly use their package and implementation
